rcon is a command line application that can be used as a Source RCON client.
It will send commands to the given server, and print the reply to stdout.

# Installation

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/rcon.svg)](https://repology.org/project/rcon/versions)

## Homebrew

[@Holek](https://github.com/Holek) has made a
[homebrew tap](https://github.com/Holek/homebrew-rcon) for rcon, which you can
use like this:

```
$ brew install Holek/rcon/rcon
```

## Manual Installation

You require ```libbsd```, ```check```, ```cmake``` and ```glib-2.0```
to successfully build rcon. You have to install those from your distribution's
repository. For example:

- In Debian you'd do something like this:
```shell
$ apt-get install build-essential cmake check libbsd-dev libglib2.0-dev
```

- In Fedora you'd do something like this:
```shell
$ dnf install @c-development cmake check-devel libbsd-devel glib2-devel
```

Then build the project:

```shell
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

A ```bash-completion``` script is available, but not installed by default.
If you use bash completion simply specify ```INSTALL_BASH_COMPLETION=ON``` on
the cmake command line:

```shell
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DINSTALL_BASH_COMPLETION=ON
```

## Debian package

If you prefer to build a Ubuntu/Debian package out of the source code: You can!
Just run the following command in the source code:

```
$ dpkg-buildpackage -b -uc -us
```

You will need the `dpkg-dev` and `debhelper` packages of course, which contain
`dpkg-buildpackage`, and all the dependencies as they are listed in the manual
installation section above.

# Documentation

The utility comes with a man page: ```rcon(1)```. View it with:
```man 1 rcon```.

# Usage

## Command Line

The command can be called from the command line directly, like so:

```
$ rcon -H somehost -p someport -P somepass status
```

rcon automatically concats all your arguments together into one command:

```
$ rcon -H somehost -p someport -P somepass sm plugins list
```

This sends the command "sm plugins list" to the server.

## Standard Input

If you wish to send more than one command to the server, don't specify one on
the command line. Instead give rcon a list of commands through standard input:

```shell
$ rcon -H somehost -p someport -P somepass <<EOS
status
sm plugins list
# This might be long!
cvarlist
EOS
```

In this mode lines starting with ```#``` are ignored. This allows rcon to be
used as a script interpreter. Just pass it the script file through stdin:

```shell
$ cat somescript.txt
# This is a comment
status

# and this too!
sm plugins list

cvarlist
```

And execute your script like this:

```shell
$ rcon -H somehost -p someport -P somepass < somescript.txt
# Or:
$ cat somescript.txt | rcon -H somehost -p someport -P somepass
```

## Security Concerns

Please note that the RCON protocol is not encrypted, meaning that your
passwords are transmitted in plain text to the server.

## Exit Code

The command exit with 0 on success, and some arbitrary non-zero exit code on
failure.

# Config file

You can also store your server credentials in a configuration file. The default
location for this file is ```$HOME/.rconrc```. You can specify an alternate
configuration file through the ```-c``` option. Entries from this configuration
file are referenced through the ```-s``` option.

Here is an example configuration file:

```
[somehost]
hostname = 174.53.163.41
port = 27045
password = somepass
# remove the following line if the server
# is not minecraft, or set it to 'false'
minecraft = true
```

Now you can do:

```
$ rcon -s somehost status
```

# Notable Forks

[dad's variant](https://github.com/dad98253/rcon) is a fork of rcon that offers
an ncurses interface. Perfect for running it in a local or remote shell.
